For this project, I used Ruby on Rails, HAML, CSS and Jquery.

Items from column A can be dragged and reorganized in the same column, while items in the column B can be drag and drop to the stage area. If items from column B are dropped any other place they will go back to their original position.

Pending implementations: Improve the responsive experience of the application and convert the stylesheet to SASS
